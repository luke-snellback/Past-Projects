# Heart Disease Predictive Models

This project evaluates three machine learning models to predict heart disease risk using a dataset of over 319,000 respondents. The goal is to identify key health factors and demographic traits linked to increased risk and compare the performance of classification models.

## Key Highlights
- Models used: Logistic Regression, KNN Classification, and Decision Tree.
- SMOTE was applied to balance a heavily imbalanced dataset.
- Logistic Regression had the highest specificity and overall performance.
- Age, gender (male), prior strokes, and smoking were top predictors.

## Purpose
To help healthcare providers and insurers identify at-risk individuals and implement preventative strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Tools & Methods
- RStudio for modeling
- SMOTE for class balance
- Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa score evaluations
